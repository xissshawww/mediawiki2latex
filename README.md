# mediawiki2latex
## official introduction
MediaWiki to LaTeX converts Wiki pages to LaTeX and PDF. It works with any website running MediaWiki, especially Wikipedia and Wikibooks. MediaWiki to LaTeX is purely written in the purely functional language Haskell. It was mainly devolved by Dirk Hünniger. The source code is freely available under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Binary releases for the most common operating systems are available for download. The Debian package is maintained by Georges Khaznadar.

## my use
I use [this](https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Dirk_H%C3%BCnniger/wb2pdf/install) tool to generate pdfs of wikipedia pages.
